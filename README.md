# Shop-Simulation

This project simulates the operations of a shop using the SimPy library in Python. Customers enter the shop at random intervals, select goods, and proceed to cash terminals for payment. The simulation handles queue management at the terminals and operates within a simulated time frame from 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM. Key statistics, such as queue lengths and customer counts, are visualized using Matplotlib. The project provides insights into customer flow and shop efficiency under varying conditions.
